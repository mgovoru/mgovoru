## About me:
I love seeing web-design come to life. I want to develop in this direction. I like the IT field, because technology gives people freedom and well-being. We can choose in life between the red and the blue pill. Now the metaphor seems relevant to me: red is knowledge, blue is ignorance. And I choose red.
